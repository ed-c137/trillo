This is the second project from the [Jonas Schmedtmann's Advanced CSS and Sass course.](https://www.udemy.com/advanced-css-and-sass/ "Udemy | Advanced CSS and Sass: Flexbox, Grid, Animations and More!")

Besides flexbox, the course covers the usage of SVG icons, BEM methodology, CSS variables, animations and transitions as well as responsive design, some handy CSS tricks and helpful online tools.
